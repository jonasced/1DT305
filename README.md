# 1DT305

Here I write test and prototype codesnippets preparing for the final project.

## Structure:
Code functions which can be reused by several projects in a separate folder, and insert them into lib of the project in which it shall be used.
 
## Missing files:
keys.py is used by Python and Pybytes to store credentials
keys.h is used by Arduino to store credentials
